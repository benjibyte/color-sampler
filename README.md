# Color Pallet Creator

I love to paint on Procreate and Krita, but myself and my mother were facing issues with the default behavior of how Procreate imports colors from an image. So I decided to make this little piece of software for her birthday. The color scheme of the website used the Everforest pallet made by Sainhe.
